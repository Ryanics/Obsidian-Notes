Adding a radio station into Star Trucker isn't as hard nor complicated to deal with as Euro Trucker, which isn't all that hard to deal with anyways. Just go to "insert location here/radios" where you'll find a file that holds all the information about the radio stations that you want to connect to and listen to in game. 

Follow this format "insert format here" And you'll be golden from there.
