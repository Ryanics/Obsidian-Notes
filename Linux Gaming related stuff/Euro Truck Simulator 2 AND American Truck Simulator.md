When setting up the radio, make sure to use this format:


Once you've placed it into your ____ file, 
you'll be fine. 
But wait, make sure you are putting this into your documents file based on your PREFIX, not on where your game's original prefix is. The documents will be created as a seperate set of folders in the prefix for Trucker MP's launcher in steam, and in that prefix, all the documents will be created. With that, it means that the radio station file will read from the prefix, rather than the place where the single player's radio station file is.
